# Diagnostics: doctor, check, and the support bundle

Use these commands to diagnose why fifi will not run, before or after a failure.
None loads model weights, starts a server, or touches the network.

```text
enginesrv doctor [--config <path>] [--json] [--bundle <file>]
enginesrv check <model_dir> [--tokenizer-dir <dir>] [--family <name>]
                 [--context <tokens>] [--kv <f32|bf16|q8>] [--json]
enginesrv config effective <path> [--json]
```

- `doctor` — what this build can serve on this machine: compiled backends,
  CUDA device and free VRAM, host RAM and threads. With `--config`, also
  validates that file.
- `check` — one model directory preflighted: compatibility verdict, the
  checks behind it, and a memory estimate. Exit 0 when servable.
- `config effective` — the resolved configuration with the origin of every
  value (config file, environment, family default, or compiled default).

## The support bundle

```bash
enginesrv doctor --bundle fifi-bundle.json --config engine/config/qwen36-cuda-3090-kv8-prefix.json
```

This writes one JSON document you can attach to an issue. It works with no GPU,
no model, and no running server — those facts are recorded as unavailable,
never guessed. An existing file is never overwritten; the write is atomic
(a `.part` sibling, then one rename).

What is inside:

- `fifi` — version and platform; `os` — the distribution's `PRETTY_NAME`.
- `hardware` — the same probe `doctor` runs, every value labeled
  `measured` or `unavailable`.
- `engines` — for each configured engine: the preflight report `check`
  prints, and the effective settings rows `config effective` prints,
  each with its origin. A broken config or an unreadable model directory
  degrades to an `unavailable` note for that engine; the rest of the
  bundle is still written.
- `manifest` — which sections were collected, unavailable, or not
  requested.
- `summary` — the same text the CLI prints.

What is deliberately not inside: API keys or any environment values
beyond the allowlisted `Q36_CACHE_LIMIT` the settings rows read, prompts
or completions (no request data is an input), logs (no log source is
read — attach yours separately), and model or tokenizer contents. Home
directory paths become `~` everywhere, including paths quoted inside
refusal messages. Loading stages exist only in a running server, so the
bundle records that section as unavailable rather than inventing it.

Inspect the file before sharing it:

```bash
jq .summary fifi-bundle.json
jq '.engines[0].preflight.checks' fifi-bundle.json
```
